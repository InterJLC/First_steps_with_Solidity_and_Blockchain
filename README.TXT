1. First of all, I have to say the solidity contract it's not a genuine creation. Its based in a public template.
   This template is available in Open Zeppelin.

2. The project's name it's: Bitzum (BZM).

3. The token it's created inside the BSC.

4. To run the contract I used Ethereum Remix.

5. To launch the coin/token I used PancakeSwap.

6. You can track it in DexTools: https://www.dextools.io/app/es/bnb/pair-explorer/0x9295082057173f1ec7d91ba42ddc53f035397440

7. There is no will or purpose to use this token in a comercial level.
